# GPU-based-ray-tracer
Welcome, this is my SoC project. \

We are primarily following the book Ray Tracing in One Weekend for this project. Uptil now I have done upto the Week 3 part 1 of the work we were assigned leaving 2 parts of Week 3 remaining which I am currently working on.  \
Uptil now we have written the required basic classes and setup for the camera. \
I learnt a lot about good coding habits in terms of variable names and dividing code into separate files with this project. I also got a really nice introduction to the field of computer graphics. I did not know how images and pixels worked, now I learnt about the PPM image format and how to generate colored images which was interesting.  \
I learnt a lot of new cpp features such as virtual functions, class inheritance and smart pointers which I did not know at all earlier. \
